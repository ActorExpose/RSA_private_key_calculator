# RSA private key calculator GUI version
Just a GUI version of the commandline tool. Cross platform, but you need PyQt5 (But there's a windows binary in the releases that doesn't require anything, not even python). Just cd into the directory and enter python RSA_d_calc.py.

Hope you find it useful!
